## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This was the first time taking on a challenge/project of this size and I learned a lot.

How to structure a page layout, and how to plan such a project before implementing it.

Did what I could with the current knowledge of HTML and CSS but would like to return to this project to correct any mistakes I made along the way.
